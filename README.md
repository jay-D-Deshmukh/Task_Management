User Authentication: The application likely has user authentication functionality, allowing users to register, log in, and log out. This ensures that only authenticated users can access certain features or data.
Task CRUD Operations: Users can create, read, update, and delete tasks. These operations allow users to manage their tasks effectively. The CRUD functionality likely involves API endpoints on the server-side to handle these operations.
View All Tasks: There's a page or component where users can view all their tasks. This page/component lists all the tasks belonging to the currently authenticated user. Tasks might be displayed in a list format, with options to delete or update each task.
Create Task: Users can create new tasks by filling out a form or providing relevant information. After creating a task, it gets added to the list of tasks for that user.
Update Task: Users can update existing tasks, modifying details such as the title, description, or any other relevant information. This feature might involve a separate form or modal for editing tasks.
Delete Task: Users can delete tasks they no longer need. Typically, there's a delete button or action associated with each task in the list, allowing users to remove tasks from their task list.
Token-Based Authentication: The application likely uses token-based authentication for securing API endpoints. When a user logs in, they receive a JSON Web Token (JWT) that they include in subsequent requests to authenticate themselves.
Error Handling: The application should handle errors gracefully, providing meaningful error messages to users when something goes wrong. This includes errors during authentication, task operations, and network requests.
Styling and UI: The application likely has a user-friendly interface with proper styling and layout. It might use CSS frameworks like Tailwind CSS or Bootstrap for styling components and ensuring consistency in design.
Client-Server Interaction: The frontend interacts with the backend server via HTTP requests. This includes sending requests to fetch tasks, create new tasks, update existing tasks, and delete tasks.




Frontend Dependencies:
React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
Preact: A fast 3kB alternative to React with the same modern API.
Axios: A promise-based HTTP client for making AJAX requests.
js-cookie: A simple, lightweight JavaScript API for handling cookies.
React Router: A routing library for React applications.
Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for quickly building custom designs.
Bootstrap (optional): Another popular CSS framework for building responsive and mobile-first websites.
FontAwesome (optional): A library of scalable vector icons that can be easily customized using CSS.
Webpack (optional): A module bundler for JavaScript applications, often used with React for bundling assets.
Babel (optional): A JavaScript compiler that transforms ECMAScript 2015+ code into a backwards-compatible version of JavaScript.
